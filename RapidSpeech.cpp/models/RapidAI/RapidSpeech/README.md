# RapidSpeech.cpp (https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidSpeech.cpp)️

**RapidSpeech.cpp** is a high-performance, **edge-native speech intelligence framework** built on top of **ggml**.  
It aims to provide **pure C++**, **zero-dependency**, and **on-device inference** for large-scale ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) models.

------

## Key Differentiators

While the open-source ecosystem already offers powerful cloud-side frameworks such as **vLLM-omni**, as well as mature on-device solutions like **sherpa-onnx**, **RapidSpeech.cpp** introduces a new generation of design choices focused on edge deployment.

### 1. vs. vLLM: Edge-first, not cloud-throughput-first

- **vLLM**
    - Designed for data centers and cloud environments
    - Strongly coupled with Python and CUDA
    - Maximizes GPU throughput via techniques such as PageAttention

- **RapidSpeech.cpp**
    - Designed specifically for **edge and on-device inference**
    - Optimized for **low latency, low memory footprint, and lightweight deployment**
    - Runs on embedded devices, mobile platforms, laptops, and even NPU-only systems
    - **No Python runtime required**
